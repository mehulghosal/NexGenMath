  A linear equation is one in the form: $$ax + b = c$$The \(ax\) is considered the <b>variable term</b>, while \(b\) and \(c\) are considered <b> constant terms</b>. <br> <br>
  To solve a linear equation, you place all the constant terms on one side of the equation, and keep all of the variable terms on the other. Usually, this results in an equation of $$ax = c-b$$
  Then, to solve for \(x\), you just divide by \(a\). This results in $$x = \frac{c-b}{a}$$
  For example, begin with the equation \(6x - 18 = 6\). Isolating the variable term changes this equation to \(6x = 24\). Dividing both sides of the equation by \(6\) solves for \(x=4\).
