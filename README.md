#  **NexGenMath**

## Platform to make math easier and more intuitive

* Submitted to hackNYU 2019
* Built by Mehul Ghosal and Alex Weiss 

## Inspiration
* We are both juniors in high school, and although we are very STEM oriented students, we sometimes have trouble understanding math class
* Abstract math is had enough; not having good teachers makes comprehending difficult topics near impossible
* We spent hours trying to teach ourselves these subjects - even the most comprehensive study helpers, like Khan Academy or Youtube don't have everything we want
* There are decent teachers online, but not enough practice problems are available to test our understanding
* The few problems you might scrap together rarely, if ever, come with helpful solutions & guides

## The App
* The app we built, called 'Nex Gen Math' is meant to solve these problems
* Our first section is a home or profile page that links to the most recommended lessons and practice
* We plan to cover a broad range of mathematical topics
* Our main attraction will be the many practice problems with walkthroughs and step-by-step solutions
* Our simple, beautiful UI and UX add to the intuitiveness of using the app on a daily basis to learn and strengthen mathemtical skills 
	* The integration with LaTeX is an aspect we are very proud of
* Because everything will be free, we will appeal to any and all kinds of students

##  Built With
* Flutter, made by Google for cross platform usability on Android and iOS devices
* We wrote our backend with Firebase
	* All of the firebase code is located on branch "firebase"

## Limitations & Struggles
* This is both of our first major exposure to Flutter, so we were uncomfortable to begin with
	* Dart is almost based on Java, but there are enough synactical and logical differences to cause us to stumble about
	* integrating the backend api and modifying design elements were especially tricky
* Also, because of time limitations, we could not fully write every lesson plan and come up with all kinds of problems
	* Obviously, math cannot be quantified to three or four generic topics, but we had to focus and hone in on a few areas for the sake of the project


## For the Future
* We will defintely include cross-language support so our audience can expand greatly
* Obviously, we will be constantly adding new topics - we hope to maintain this app for a while
* We can also look into running outreach campaigns targeted to schools to increase the use of our app in the daily lives of students
